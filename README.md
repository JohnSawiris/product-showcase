### Elements Used

| Term | Description | Implementation |
| ----- |:------------:|:-----------|
| Box-Sizing | Tells the browser what parts of the box model to include | I applied it to everything|
| Float | Float takes elements out the normal flow and let them float left or right | I applied it on the NAV links and the images in the grid |
| Display: block | It lets elements behave as a block level element | I applied it on the clear fix and also on the image so I'd be able to center them |
| Display: inline | It lets the elements behave as inline elements, in which case they won't have margin top and margin bottom | I applied it on the UL and LI elements in the NAV element |
| Centered Content | It centers the content in its parent element | I used it to center the wrapper div, form elements, main section, and the images in the main section |
| Psuedo Element | It adds content to the HTML using the CSS | I used :after for the clear fix to add content after the element that clear fix class i applied to |
| Psuedo Class | It defines a state of an element | I applied to the Sign Up BUTTON in the form and to the LIsin the NAV |
| Clear Fix | It solves the issue of collapsing the parent of floating element | I applied it to the nav, hero section, and main section |
| Positional Selector | It selects elements based on their position | I used it to apply specific styling to li in nav, divs that wraps the images in the grid, and the paragraphs underneath the images |
| Selector Combinator | It can grab descendant selector, child, adjacent, and general siblings | I used on the form input, p in the footer, and the divs inside the main section |
